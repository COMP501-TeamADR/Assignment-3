		<h1>Chosen Technology/Topic</h1>
			<p>As a group we chose to look at Virtual Reality(VR) technology, specifically focusing on its impact on the workplace. This entails us looking at how VR could change the way we work for the better, shifting the work environment into a place that is physically, mentally and functionally better for the people working within it. One of the potential players for this technology being implemented on a global scale is Meta (formerly Facebook) with their Metaverse. For this slide we’ll focus on looking at the opportunities brought about from VR technology and how it can revolutionize several industries for the better in the next coming years. This slide will focus on some of the key benefits of VR technology this includes but is not limited to: workplace design, production/manufacturing, worker well-being, immersive virtual environment (IVE’s) and how the Metaverse plays into IVE’s.</p>
			<br>
			<p>First, we’ll talk about VR’s impact on workplace design as well as on production/manufacturing. A paper produced by the University of Patras talked about how workplace layout affects worker productivity, wellbeing, physical and mental fatigue, and production costs. The current systems utilised by companies consists of observational methods, software simulations, even full size prototypes. These all hold plenty of drawbacks such as; inefficiency, being uninsightful and having high costs and implementation time respectively. VR solves this by allowing workers to test and utilise prototypes within an immersive system that tracks them virtually performing tasks and allows for the visualisation of key performance indicators (KPI’s). On the side of larger scale manufacturing and production, a paper produced by the University of Campania Luigi Vanvitelli and FCA (Fiat Chrysler Automobiles) Italy focused on the use of 3D virtual spaces in revolutionising the way they produce vehicles whilst using motion capture systems to truly design and showcase different points of views to create a human-centred workplace.</p>
			<br>
			<p>When it comes to workplace induced stress year after year the number of workers being pushed to their mental and physical limits are increasing. A survey by Dynamic Signal reiterated by Stress.org said “Dynamic Signal conducted a survey among more than 1,000 US workers, with 80% if them reporting being stressed out because of poor communication practices by their employers, a 30% increase from the previous year.” This survey was done in 2019, a year prior to COVID-19 and its corresponding lockdowns. In response to this workplace stress management roles are vital to worker safety and overall worker health. An article published by liebertpub.com illustrated the “growing body of evidence supporting the efficacy of virtual reality (VR) treatments for stress and anxiety” Whilst the article doesn’t explicitly say that VR technology will reduce stress and anxiety in the workplace. It strongly implies the gap in research that needs to be filled.</p>
			<br>
			<p>An appropriately predictable method of VR technology being used in the workplace is the use of IVE’s (Immersive Virtual Environment). A paper published by degruyter.com talked about the use of VR technology for adapting workplaces for workers with motion disability. “For this task, a computer-generated human model with a visualization of maximal arm reach and preferred working space was developed. Custom-made software was used to create a virtual working space, to adjust the human model’s measurements and constraints to reflect a disabled person, and to analyse necessary modifications. An immersive virtual reality environment was used to assess a modified workplace and to add further modifications.” That paper used an actual software generated IVE, showcasing directly IVE’s can be used in the workplace. Another paper published by Copenhagen Business School looked specifically at Bauman’s concept of liquid modernity, as well as other concepts. They argue that the workplace is moving from a collective-based workforce, to an individual-based workforce. “The first contribution is to close the knowledge gap that exists in the academic literature on IVEs in a work context. Second, practitioners will have a better understanding of the changes IVEs have on workplaces and how we feel present in them.”  This paper explores further the possibilities of IVEs in the workplace as well as the need for more work context related IVE literature.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Lastly, I’ll talk about the Metaverse and how it relates to VR technology in the workplace. A paper published by researchers at the University of Muenster talked about the framework and their very own road map on the value of real-time multisensory social interactions in the VR space of the Metaverse. “Focusing on real-time multisensory social interactions (RMSIs) as a focal element of the metaverse, this research investigates whether RMSIs in the virtual-reality metaverse generate more value than those on the 2D internet (e.g., Zoom meetings).” This paper is important for the discussion and research of VR technology, specifically the Metaverse, in the workplace. Due to the uncertainty of the benefits of a 3D interactive space over the traditional 2D internet. Touching on social presence, social interactions and computer-mediated environments (IVEs).</p>
			<br>
			<p>All in all, its clear to see that the global industries as well as research centres are looking towards VR to make a meaningful impact to their business. We believe that VR technology is the future of the workplace and we’ve demonstrated that through these examples given.</p>
