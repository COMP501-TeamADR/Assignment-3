		<h1>Chosen Technology/Topic</h1>
			<p>As a group we chose to look at Virtual Reality(VR) technology, specifically focusing on its impact on the workplace. This entails us looking at how VR could change the way we work for the better, shifting the work environment into a place that is physically, mentally and functionally better for the people working within it. One of the potential players for this technology being implemented on a global scale is Meta (formerly Facebook) with their Metaverse. For this slide we’ll focus on looking at the opportunities brought about from VR technology and how it can revolutionize several industries for the better in the next coming years. This slide will focus on some of the key benefits of VR technology this includes but is not limited to: workplace design, production/manufacturing, worker well-being, immersive virtual environment (IVE’s) and how the Metaverse plays into IVE’s.</p>
			<br>
			<p>First, we’ll talk about VR’s impact on workplace design as well as on production/manufacturing. A paper produced by the University of Patras talked about how workplace layout affects worker productivity, wellbeing, physical and mental fatigue, and production costs. The current systems utilised by companies consists of observational methods, software simulations, even full size prototypes. These all hold plenty of drawbacks such as; inefficiency, being uninsightful and having high costs and implementation time respectively. VR solves this by allowing workers to test and utilise prototypes within an immersive system that tracks them virtually performing tasks and allows for the visualisation of key performance indicators (KPI’s). On the side of larger scale manufacturing and production, a paper produced by the University of Campania Luigi Vanvitelli and FCA (Fiat Chrysler Automobiles) Italy focused on the use of 3D virtual spaces in revolutionising the way they produce vehicles whilst using motion capture systems to truly design and showcase different points of views to create a human-centred workplace.</p>
