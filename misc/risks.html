<h1>Technology Risks</h1>

<p>
With the continuous advancement of virtual reality technology, individuals now have new tools and methods that could potentially jeopardize the user in a variety of different ways. A study performed by the University of New Haven in 2019, provides insight into the numerous techniques that could be used against users of virtual reality devices. A few examples of these techniques involve:  gaining access to the head mounting display(HMD), overlaying images on the user’s vision or even modifying the virtual environment the user is in. Through these methods an individual could perform a new type of cyber attack on a business deploying virtual reality devices for remote working e.g. Metaverse. Because some of these breaches have the capacity to harm the user, systems must be put in place that ensure the user’s safety. Alongside this, because virtual reality is heavily reliant on capturing the information of the user such as the surrounding environment or their physical qualities, there is the potential for this information to be  abused. In order for virtual reality to be a safe and reliable option, systems  and regulations must be put in place to keep the user and their information safe.
