		<h1>Technology Risks</h1>
			<p>
    	With the continuous advancement of virtual reality technology, individuals now have new tools and methods that could potentially jeopardise the user in a variety of different ways. A study performed by the University of New Haven in 2019, provides insight into the numerous techniques that could be used against users of virtual reality devices. Examples of these techniques involve: Disorientation attack, gaining access to the head mounting display(HMD), overlay attack, chaperone Attack or even modifying the virtual environment the user is in. A disorientation attack involves a hacker changing the user’s orientation in virtual space through rotation and lateral movements; this in turn causes the user to feel disoriented causing potential injury. When a hacker gains access to the head mounted display on the virtual reality device, they are able to view the environment the user is in. This allows the hacker to gain additional information about the user e.g. where they are, their living condition and other personal information. An overlay attack is when the hacker places images on the user’s screen. This could be implemented in a variety of ways such as, flashing imagery on screen fast enough to cause a seizure, scaring the user and hiding their screen. A chaperone attack involves the hacker changing the set boundaries the user is in; this could be used to lead the user towards a specific part of their environment, making them knock over things or hurt themselves. Through these methods an individual could perform a new type of cyber attack on a business deploying virtual reality devices for remote working e.g. Metaverse. Because some of these breaches have the capacity to harm the user, systems must be put in place that ensure the user’s safety. Alongside this, because virtual reality is heavily reliant on capturing the information of the user such as the surrounding environment or their physical qualities, there is the potential risk of this information being abused. The recent Facebook controversy regarding the sharing of user information in the EU, is an example of how hackers aren't the only threat on user information. In order for virtual reality to be a safe and reliable option in wider society e.g. home and work use, systems and regulations must be put in place to keep the user and their information safe.

		<h2>Choices for implementing VR technology:</h2>
			As virtual reality technology continues to be developed, there are increasing ways that it is being implemented into our lives. Currently virtual reality is being used in various aspects such as virtual spaces, CAD, virtual art, video games. Virtual spaces encompass the social aspects of virtual reality such as remote work and online social interaction. Over the course of the covid-19 pandemic, remote working and learning has become increasingly popular however it may cause people to feel isolated at times. By utilising a virtual reality headset and virtual space, users are able to have the feeling of being in the same room as other people, reducing the feelings of isolation and loneliness. Popular virtual spaces are hosted on VR-chat and Metaverse, where users can create their own worlds and socialise within these environments, allowing people to stay connected despite being distanced from each other. Virtual reality is also being used in CAD as it provides the designers with a new perspective on how they are able to view their 3D models. Designers are able to create a 3D model and then import that model into a 3D space in virtual reality, which is then viewed from the perspective of a human in real life. This allows designers/modellers to gain a deeper understanding of the scale and feasibility of their models/products. Similarly to CAD, virtual reality has offered users the ability to freely express themselves in a virtual space. There are a plethora of art related apps that cover every facet of art such as painting, modelling, design etc. Users can use these apps to freely express themselves, when they may have been physically limited in the real world e.g wealth or disabilities. Virtual reality is being slowly implemented into our lives and this will only continue as the technology is advanced. VR provides new perspectives and helpful solutions to the various different problems we as a society face in the world, whether that be a pandemic or a more accessible environment and mediums for those facing disabilities.
