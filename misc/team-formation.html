		<h1>Team Formation Form</h1>

		<p>Our group decided to evenly distribute the workload between the three of us. This ensured that the work was completed efficiently and to a high standard. Our end goal for this project was to construct a visually appealing and also an informative website that showed people the future of how we communicate and operate businesses/organisations in the workspace through VR(virtual reality). We made sure that each member of our team was informed on what to do in the work session and encouraged doubts to be cleared and questions to be asked as this streamlined our workflow. We did take calculated risks in working together from home, however we felt that this did in fact increase team morale and work efficiency. In addition to that, we made sure to catch up at least once a week on the AUT city campus to clear any doubts and/or questions. Between the two, As a group we can collectively agree that we did our best to complete the project, especially as we had 2 of our group members test positive for coronavirus subsequently, which meant that we had almost 2 weeks in a row where our effort was understandable not a collective 100%.  This meant that the week after we had recovered from covid we had to work twice as hard to complete the project by the deadline and still maintain a high standard of work.</p>

		<p>Rhodes decided to volunteer for the role of team leader, where he set simple goals for us each work session and team catch-up we had. This made sure that as a group, we were on target to completing the project on time. He also decided to research the social implications of Facebook Meta on society. Rhodesâ€™ genuine interest in how new technological advancements affect society as a whole made him perfect for the role. </p>

		<p>Dylan was assigned to be in charge of the website design and layout. His previous experience in HTML coding and creating websites in his own time ensured that our website would be up to standard. Also, as he enjoys visual design in his spare time, as a group we knew that Dylan would ensure our website was visually appealing. This is important to us as a group, as we felt that a visually appealing but also an informative website was our ideal outcome/end goal for this project.</p>

		<p>Akash was assigned to be incharge of APA referencing. His genuine interest in where the facts, figures and data used in our project originate from makes him suited for the role. Also his passion for ensuring that the people who did the studies to find the figures are properly credited ensured that the project did not break plagiarism rules. APA referencing is an important part of the project as it adds clarity and also credibility to our project, as relevant and trusted sources only will be cited. APA referencing also helps keep focus on the content of the project and gives better flow. </p>
