We’re going to tackle the ethical issues of equity and access and the responsibilities the potential key players hold such as Meta (previously known as Facebook) and Microsoft.  We believe this will be a strong venture from these companies in terms of progressing work communication and placing their stamp in this new era of social distancing and working at home. Therefore, it’s important to explore and expand on the possible benefits and ramifications that will arise from this eventual shift in the business world.</em></td>
